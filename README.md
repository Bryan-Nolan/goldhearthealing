For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

- __Responsive Site__

In these times of multiple devices accessing websites I have decide to make my site responsive to the following sizes

- Screen Size below 1280 pixels which to me equates to Laptop Screen.
- Screen Size bekow 768 pixels which to equates to tablet
- Screen Size below 500 pixels to suit large phone.
- Screen Size below 320 pixels to mobile.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
