- __Services Issue__

 - During the creation of the services page I came across an issue with sizing images in a the div and they were going into other div.’s
- To solve this, I found the following CSS at https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_clearfix.asp which I use.
- 
.clearfix::after {
  content: "";
  clear: both;
  display: table;
}

- __Responsive Site__

In these times of multiple devices accessing websites, I have decided to make my site responsive to the following sizes

- Screen Size below 1280 pixels which to me equates to Laptop Screen.
- Screen Size below 768 pixels which to equates to tablet
- Screen Size below 500 pixels to suit large phone.
- Screen Size below 320 pixels to mobile. 
- 
### Features for the future

- In the future I would create a facility to show available slots for treatment which could be booked by users
-_Map_
-Also I would have a map to show the location off Gold Heart Healing

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
