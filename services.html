            <h2>Reiki</h2>
            <img src="./assets/images/reiki-300.png" alt="reiki">
            <p>Reiki is a Japanese form of alternative medicine called energy healing. Reiki practitioners use a
                technique called palm healing or hands-on healing through which a "universal energy" is said to be
                transferred through the palms of the practitioner to the patient in order to encourage emotional or
                physical healing.</p>
            <p class="services-div-text">Reiki is a pseudoscience, and is used as an illustrative example of
                pseudoscience in scholarly texts
                and academic journal articles. It is based on qi ("chi"), which practitioners say is a universal
                life force, although there is no empirical evidence that such a life force exists.</p>
            <p class="services-div-text">The positive benefits of reiki can enhance your overall well-being. Researchers
                in a small 2016 study
                found that reiki was helpful in improving the quality of life for women with cancer. Women who had
                reiki showed improvements to their sleep patterns, self-confidence, and depression levels. They
                noted a sense of calm, inner peace, and relaxation.</p>

            <h2>Crystal Healing</h2>
            <img src="./assets/images/crystal-300.jpg" alt="Crystal healing">
            <p>Crystal healing is a pseudoscientific alternative-medicine practice that uses semiprecious stones and
                crystals such as quartz, agate, amethyst or opals. Adherents of the practice claim that these have
                healing powers, but there is no scientific basis for this claim. Practitioners of crystal healing
                believe they can boost low energy, prevent bad energy, release blocked energy, and transform a body's
                aura.</p>
            <p class="services-div-text">In one method, the practitioner places crystals on different parts of the body,
                often corresponding
                to chakras; or else the practitioner places crystals around the body in an attempt to construct an
                energy grid, which is purported to surround the client with healing energy. Scientific
                investigations have found no evidence that such "energy grids" actually exist, and there is no evidence
                that crystal
                healing has any greater effect upon the body than any other placebo.</p>
            <p class="services-div-text">While the practice is popular, it fosters commercial demand for crystals, which
                can result in
                environmental damage and exploitative child labor to mine the crystals.</p>

            <h2>Emotional Freedom Techniques</h2>
            <img src="./assets/images/Eft-300.jpg" alt="Emotional Freedom Techniques">
            <p>Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) is a form of counseling intervention that draws on various theories of
                alternative medicine – including acupuncture, neuro-linguistic programming, energy medicine, and Thought
                Field Therapy (TFT). It is best known through Gary Craig's EFT Handbook, published in the late 1990s,
                and related books and workshops by a variety of teachers. EFT and similar techniques are often discussed
                under the umbrella term "energy psychology."</p>
            <p class="services-div-text">Advocates claim that the technique may be used to treat a wide variety of
                physical and psychological
                disorders, and as a simple form of self-administered therapy.[1] The Skeptical Inquirer describes
                the
                foundations of EFT as "a hodgepodge of concepts derived from a variety of sources, [primarily] the
                ancient Chinese philosophy of chi, which is thought to be the 'life force' that flows throughout the
                body." The existence of this life force is "not empirically supported."</p>
            <p class="services-div-text">EFT has no benefit as a therapy beyond the placebo effect or any known
                effective psychological
                techniques that may be provided in addition to the purported "energy" technique.[3] It is generally
                characterized as pseudoscience, and it has not garnered significant support in clinical psychology.</p>

            <h2>Feng Shui</h2>
            <img src="./assets/images/FengShui-300.jpg" alt="Feng Shui">
            <p>Feng shui also known as Chinese geomancy, is a pseudoscientific traditional practice originating from
                ancient China, which claims to use energy forces to harmonize individuals with their surrounding
                environment. The term 'feng shui' literally translates as "wind-water" in English, and is a cultural
                shorthand taken from the passage of the now-lost Book of Burial recorded in Guo Pu's commentary.</p>
            <p class="services-div-text">Feng shui is one of the Five Arts of Chinese Metaphysics, classified as
                physiognomy (observation of
                appearances through formulas and calculations). The feng shui practice discusses architecture in
                terms of "invisible forces" that bind the universe, earth, and humanity together, known as qi.</p>
            <p class="services-div-text">Historically, feng shui was widely used to orient buildings—often spiritually
                significant structures
                such as tombs, but also dwellings and other structures—in an auspicious manner. Depending on the
                particular style of feng shui being used, an auspicious site could be determined by reference to local
                features
                such as bodies of water, stars, or the compass.</p>

            <img src="./assets/images/numerology-300.jpg" alt="Numerology">
            <p>Numerology is the belief in the divine or mystical relationship between a number and one or more
                coinciding events. It is also the study of the numerical value of the letters in words, names, and
                ideas. It is often associated with the paranormal, alongside astrology and similar to divinatory arts.
            </p>
            <p class="services-div-text">In simple terms, numerology is a study of numbers in your life. You can uncover
                information about the
                world and also each individual person by using Numerology. Numerology is seen as a universal
                language of
                numbers.</p>
            <p class="services-div-text">Numerology can look incredibly complex, and there are so many different types
                of numerology that you
                may not even know where to start, but if you are familiar with Astrology, then you may know a little bit
                about Numerology; it is similar in quite a few ways but uses a different method to get the
                information and insight: Numbers.</p>

            <p>Psychometry, also known as token-object reading, or psychoscopy, is a form of extrasensory perception
                characterized by the claimed ability to make relevant associations from an object of unknown history by
                making physical contact with that object. Supporters assert that an object may have an energy field that
                transfers knowledge regarding that object's history.</p>
            <p class="services-div-text">The Past is entombed in the Present! The world is its own enduring monument;
                and that which is true
                of its physical, is likewise true of its mental career. The discoveries of Psychometry will enable us
                to explore the history of man, as those of geology enable us to explore the history of the earth. There
                are mental fossils for psychologists as well as mineral fossils for the geologists; and I believe that
                hereafter the psychologist and the geologist will go hand in hand — the one portraying the earth,
                its animals and its vegetation, while the other portrays the human beings who have roamed over its
                surface in the shadows, and the darkness of primeval barbarism! Aye, the mental telescope is now
                discovered
                which may pierce the depths of the past and bring us in full view of the grand and tragic passages
                of ancient history!</p>
